# boswell
Boswell is a blood glucose level log (currently only for personal use)  
It uses [micromarkdown](https://github.com/SimonWaldherr/micromarkdown.js) to generate an HTML table  
Saving the .md file currently needs to be done manually  
This seems like it could be a useful tool for the general public especially if kept simple
